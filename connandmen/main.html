            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Here at Conn & Men Clothes, we pride ourselves on some of the most exquisite clothing currently available on the market. From elegantly designed dresses to stylised and flary men’s suits, we are sure to catch your eye with our stunning range of clothing with our long history of experience in producing unbelievable pieces of artwork, brewing tonics, providing loans & aiding customers with online call centres.</p>
            <p>Our rich and storied history delves back to 1335 with our first major client was Marcus the third. Upon request, our team produced fine, silky smooth robes with a unique twist. Utilising the latest in magic of the time, our weavers were able to intensify its beauty based upon the wit of the individual.</p>

            <img src="The Walk.webp" alt="The Walk" width="190" height="200" />
            <p>Though results were mixed due to those who were unable to see the garments, Conn & Man had just become the peak of conversation among the people, under that of the King’s new robes. This ultimately began the multigenerational business known as Conn & Men that would continue to evolve and develop to this current day.</p>

            <div> <p></p> </div>

            <p>A travelling business by nature, Conn & Men visited vast parts of Europe hoping to find customers of high esteem to sell their wares. This deemed challenging though as after the Emperor’s unreasonable dissatisfaction for his robes, the weaving industry suffered greatly. Travelling the roads of Europe, Conn & Men found customers looking to buy robes far & scarce as the cost of producing such robes were beyond most member’s costs, interests or desire.  </p>
            <p>This sparked Conn & Men’s evolution into a new era of products which were more affordable to the everyday individual. Snake oils and natural remedies. Being a fraction of the cost and a lot more produceable in large quantities, Conn & Men’s natural cures were a hit for small, localised communities.</p>

            <img src="Sales Failed.webp" alt="Failed Sales" width="190" height="200" />
            <img src="Snake Oil.webp" alt="The Cure" width="190" height="200" />

            <img src="Stinking Ritch.webp" alt="Money" width="190" height="200" />
            <p>Our pockets were once more were aligned with gold and with an even bigger desire to help the community! Though many of the uses of the tonic evolved from the placebo effect, our business was not one to dispel nonfactual information or to educate the public on their interpretations.</p>

            <div> <p></p> </div>

            <p>With people looking to explore the world and needing the funds to do it, Conn & Men found a way to finally give back to the public through means of loans. Due to the risk & reward of running a loaning business, our loans did warrant a higher inflation to that of a regular bank.</p>
            <p>Though being kinder & more understanding than your general bank, we were happy to loan the money to less well off souls who were of higher risk. Where members were unable to pay back the loan in time, members at Conn & Men found every member capable of contributing back through the utility of physical labour!</p>

            <img src="Invest In Workers.webp" alt="Work" width="190" height="200" />
            <p>Though many were unable to pay off their loan within their working career’s lifetime, we at Conn & Man do believe we allowed members of society to achieve big with our support and continue to offer loans to members looking for support!</p>
            
            <div> <p></p> </div>

            <p>During the 19th Century, Conn & Men developed a new form of business in sweepstakes and lottery events. With the growing popularity in gambling at pubs and racing centres, Conn & Men were able to find their new form of business. Hosting Giveaways and our own little lotteries, you could win big with a little bit of luck on your side.</p>

            <img src="Gambling Win.webp" alt="Winner" width="190" height="200" />
            <p>Conn & Men would like to state that any allegations of fraudulent activity in regards to lottery and sweepstake scams are held in lies and have no official factual basis. Just ask our friendly staff who have won our events a great many times! On the other hand, what is true is that Conn & Men did indeed run Arcades & Casinos in the late 1970s though due to legal issues and push back from local governing agencies, Conn & Men Arcades & Casinos sadly closed down in the 1980s.</p>

            <div> <p></p> </div>

            <p>Our most current business comes in the form of mobile support centres across the world to aid in any troubles you may have. We assist in accidental credit card charges, assistance with lottery and prize claims, giving you support for device security we offer, letting you know about data breaches or needing to fill out legal information such as your tax returns or even updating your driver’s license. We currently have call centres in Nigeria, India, the Philippines, and Ghana. </p>

            <p>Don’t be alarmed if we try to get onto your computer, phone or ask for any of your personal details as this is typical protocol for our call centres to validate you as a customer and not some phony trying to scammer or trick us.</p>
